# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Definition

The Customer Churn table includes data on 7,043 customers of a California telecommunications company in Q2 2022. Each record provides customer details on demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, and their status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned).

The Zip Code Population table offers complementary data on the estimated populations for the California zip codes listed in the Customer Churn table.

We aim to predict whether a customer will churn, stay, or join the company based on the dataset parameters.
